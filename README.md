# Prototype3-CardGame
 
I'm gonna work on Clock (patience). It seemed like the most interesting of the 5 options,
that also seemed manageable for implementing the gameplay. I had plans on doing either
Pyramid or Golf, but they seemed too simple, and because I felt I had the time
I wanted to challange myself. I figure that the layout shouldnt be too crazy as setting up
spots for the cards to be dealt out, and then spaces for the cards to end up in. The most 
challanging thing would mostlikely be figuring out how to check not only the game ending 
condition, but also whether or not the player won. In the end, it seemed like a fun 
version of Solitaire to attempt to make.
